# Travel Agency Management System

This repository contains a C program that implements a simple travel agency management system using structures. The program allows you to manage drivers, drivers' name, dirvers' DL number, drivers' route of travel, and drivers' distance covered in the travel for a travel agency.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have a C compiler installed on your system. For example, you can use GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) on Linux or MinGW on Windows.

## Instructions

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
git clone https://github.com/SinghIsWriting/Manage-a-Travel-Agency.git

2. Navigate to the cloned repository directory.

3. Compile the C program using your preferred C compiler. For example, with GCC:
gcc manage_travel_agency.c -o travel_agency

4. Run the compiled program:
./travel_agency

5. The program will display to enter drivers' name, dirvers' DL number, drivers' route of travel, and drivers' distance covered in the travel.

8. The program will handle the data using structures.

9. You can enter data of three dirvers in this particular program.

## Program Details

The `manage_travel_agency.c` file contains a program that implements a travel agency management system using structures.

The program defines structures for drivers' name, dirvers' DL number, drivers' route of travel, and drivers' distance covered in the travel.
